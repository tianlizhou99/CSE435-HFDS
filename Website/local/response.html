                <p>Hi Jesse,<br><br>


                    Thanks for sharing the SRS and prototype! Everything looks to be on track. I only had a few nitpicks and comments. I'm excited to see the final design!<br>
                    
                    
                    Product Functions is spot on. Great use references ðŸ™‚<br>
                    
                    Cyber Security Requirements are sufficient<br><br>
                    
                    Domain Model<br>
                    
                    Diagram is clean and easy to follow<br>
                    
                    Good use of cardinality<br>
                    
                    Sequence diagram for system security<br>
                    
                    One of the few teams that did this, great job<br>
                    
                    Minor note â€” Blue path will be calculated for 2,500 meters ahead<br><br>
                    
                    Prototype<br>
                    
                    The interaction is fantastic<br>
                    
                    Excited to see speed differentiation in V2<br><br>
                    
                    Nit â€” Scenario 4 is a great use case to display each level of warning (lights, audio, vibrations). Seeing the progression from fault to halting is great to see.<br>
                    
                    Overall, the prototype looks great!<br>
                    
                    
                    All the best,<br><br>
